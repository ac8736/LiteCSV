# LiteCSV

A simple online CSV viewer. Allows the user to upload their CSV file and be presented with a table view.

The goal was to provide a simple way to view CSV files, as I was not particularly fond of viewing CSV files in notepad applications where formatting was not available.

Excel was a nice alternative, but not everyone can afford to purchase Excel just to view CSV files.

### Future Planned Updates

- Some CSS to make it look fancy :)
- Handle extremely large files
